In this assignment, data science methodology was applied to the topic "Credit Card Fraud"


## Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? 

Credit Cards


## Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist. 

Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. 

You are required to:

Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.

Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.

For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?".

1. Credit card fraud

2. What are the most common characteristics of fraudulent credit card transactions?


## Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. 

Analytic Approach

Data Requirements

Data Collection

Data Understanding and Preparation

Modeling and Evaluation

You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.

1. Analytic Approach: The first step is to define the analytical approach that will be used to answer the question. In this case, we will use a supervised machine learning approach. This means that we will train a model on a dataset of historical fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The model will then be used to predict whether new transactions are fraudulent or legitimate.
   
2. Data Requirements: The second step is to define the data requirements for the project. In this case, we will need a dataset of historical fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The dataset should include information about the tima of day, the type of merchant, the location of transactions, ant the amount of the transaction.

3. Data Collection: The third step is to collect the data. In this case, the data can be colllected from the bank's own record or from a third party vendor.

4. Data Understanding an Preparation: The fourth step is to understand the data and prepare it for modeling. This includes cleaning the data, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a format that can be used by the machine learning model.
   
5. Modeling and Evaluation: The fifth step is to build the machine learning model and evaluate its performance. This can be done by splitting the dataset into a training set and a test set. The model ise then trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.
